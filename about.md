# I am Sambhu
## Before
Once upon a time there lived a man named Sambhu Surya Mohan, and that's me and I am still well and alive. I started my career when I figured out I was good with computers, that was ages ago when I was still in school. While studying I picked bits and pieces of knowledge and made my style of coding. The first style I had was very raw. I didn't read texts on programming just internet, no mentors all by myself. It had it's own disadvantage(will come to it later) but the advantage was that I started thinking in codes. I made quite a lot of programs which had lots of memory leak. One time I created a program as part of my final year project, it was to detect all the oil rigs using topological patterns. The code worked well but it needed hell lot of memory to run, in my old dell inspiron it took around 45-60 minutes(it worked probably thanks to the swap space). 

## In between
I met my first real mentor when I started my first job. He was my boss and a real genius. He taught me his way of thinking and how to code. I secretly took him as my competitor. He actually turned my raw skill to a polished diamond. As years progressed I picked up more skills and also I forgot some skills. But my thought process was always there for me. It is now my super power. 

## Now
I am now in a path to teach and share to others what I know. Some time before now I started again through all the tools and techniques and the programming I know, and started writing from scratch for the people who wants to learn from scratch. All the writing are based on my experience real time and hence if you are going through the repo know that some are complete and some have failed(but it will there for you to refer).
